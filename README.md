This was just a random chess project I hacked on for a while, it was originally going to be a weird chess variant with items, and is in need of some refactoring but it works well, sadly I never got around to writing the AI or refactoring it.. I originally called the project WhaleCombat and I'm not quite sure why.



- Supports all of the common chess peices, and supports their common movements (peices can obtain possible moves, which can be sent to an unimplemented AI )

- Peices can pick up items which are scattered around the board. 
  right now the only item type added is the pawn bump.
